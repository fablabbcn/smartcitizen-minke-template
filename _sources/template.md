# Project

!!! warning "Before or during the project"
	This section is expected to be filled out before the project starts or at it's initial stages.

> _Describe here briefly what your project is about: maybe mention what and why you are measuring and what's the community behind all of it. Try to answer the following questions:_
> 
> - _What is it that we want to measure?_
> - _Why? Is there a problem we want to characterise? A change in the environment we want to monitor?_
> - _Where are the sensors installed?_
> - _What are the requirements for the sensors? Why did you pick the sensors you are using?_
> - _Who is in charge of the handling of the sensors? And for looking at the data? Any innovative approach?_

### Sensors

> _Describe here what sensors you will be using and what will they measure._
> _Make sure to include installation images on the actual setup._

### Plan

> _Describe here what your plan is. How long will you measure for, how many sensors, and people will be involved? Are you expecting a lot of data? What are your desired metrics and their relation to potential proxies?_
> 
## Legacy

!!! warning "After the project"
	This section is expected to be filled out after the project is over.

> _Describe here the main outcomes of your project, what did you achieve and what you didn't. What is the legacy of all this work?_

### Data

> _All data should be findable and usable after the project. For others to benefit from it, we need to have clear indication of where is it stored, and some extra things:_
> 
> - _What warnings would you give to others using it?_
> - _Is it all valid?_
> - _Maybe some graphs?_

### Learning
