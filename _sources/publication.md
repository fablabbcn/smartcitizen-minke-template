# Publishing your project

Once you have all the files ready, your project is ready to see the light online.

During [MINKE TNA Open Calls](https://minke.eu), you will need to make this content available online and have it findable on the [MINKE TNA projects repository](https://participatory-tech.docs.minke.eu/Projects/).

## Making code-analysis available

If you have followed the steps in the [setup guide](setup.html#getting-the-template), you should be able to make changes to it locally and the push the code using `git` to your online repository. To deploy your website, you can make use of the `ghp-import` as explained in [accounts section of the setup guide](setup.html#accounts).

## Making data available

Not only your project needs to be documented and the data processing code available, but also the data from it. For this, we will use [scdata](https://pypi.org/project/scdata) and upload it automatically to Zenodo online platform. You can check this [guide](https://docs.smartcitizen.me/Guides/data/Upload%20data%20to%20zenodo/) for better guidance. Remember to finalize the upload in your profile!
