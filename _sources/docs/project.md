# Project

This intro page is for you to showcase your project. Here are some _bullet points_ to help you get started:

* Description: _Describe here briefly what your project is about: maybe mention what and why you are measuring and what's the community behind all of it. Try to answer the following questions:_
	+ _What is it that we want to measure?_
	+ _Why? Is there a problem we want to characterise? A change in the environment we want to monitor?_
	+ _Where are the sensors installed?_
	+ _What are the requirements for the sensors? Why did you pick the sensors you are using?_
	+ _Who is in charge of the handling of the sensors? And for looking at the data? Any innovative approach?_

* Sensors: _Describe here what sensors you will be using and what will they measure. Make sure to include installation images on the actual setup._

* Plan: _Describe here what your plan is. How long will you measure for, how many sensors, and people will be involved? Are you expecting a lot of data? What are your desired metrics and their relation to potential proxies?_
 
* Legacy: _Describe here the main outcomes of your project, what did you achieve and what you didn't. What is the legacy of all this work?_

* Citations: _You can also cite references that are stored in a `bibtex` file. Check the cheatsheet [here](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/tutorials/references.html#create-a-citation) for more info.
